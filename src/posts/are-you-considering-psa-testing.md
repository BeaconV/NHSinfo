Although from time to time there is information in the Press about Prostate Cancer and PSA Testing, it is important to also consider the risks associated with the test as not all people with elevated PSA will have cancer, and there is harm caused by testing PSA. Please read and digest the links and information below which will help you with your decision on whether you want a PSA Test.
